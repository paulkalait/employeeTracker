  ## Description
  This project was to create a fullstack application that followed all of the CRUD methods: CREATE, UPDATE, DELETE, READ employyes using java for the backend, MySQL for the database, and react.js for the frontend. I initiated the project using the spring-boot framework, that allowed me to easily configure and set up the application. JPA was also used to help manage the relational data in this application. The Backend code was written in IntelliJ DEA (EmployeeTracker folder) and the frontend code was written in VSCode (employee-tracker-frontend folder).
